# Aircraft to analysis

A workshop on image collection and analysis using tiny aircraft, for people interested in turning their output from small unpiloted aircraft into meaningful data products.

## Software required
- OpenDroneMap for your platform: https://opendronemap.org
- QGIS for your platform: https://qgis.org
- Miniconda (prerequisite for PDAL) if needed: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- PDAL, the point data abstraction library: https://pdal.io (follow instructions to install using the Conda package manager)

## Discusssion topics
- Safe flying: how to check local rules and regulations, and what to do if you are uncertain about whether flying drones is allowed
- Flight setup: things to be aware of before flying
- Data collection patterns: how to fly to get the most out of your energy and effort (and investment)

## Practical components
- Flying to collect data: preflight, capture, postflight (only attendees with relevant licenses who have bought their own aircraft along)
- Indoor data collection if possible for anyone who is not licensed, using a DJI Tello or similar
- Ground control points
- Processing with opendronemap:
    - WebODM
    - Command line

## Analysing results with PDAL

## Debrief topics
- Accuracy: what is meaningful? What were our expectations and how did they match the results we got?
- Data uses and limitations
